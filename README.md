The clock is a program that displays the current time, date, and has the ability to set multiple alarms simultaneously. 
Added alarms are shown on a list in the user interface. 
When a specific alarm triggers, the user has the option to disable it by pressing "OK," which removes it from the alarm list,
or they can choose the "SNOOZE" option, which adds a specified number of minutes to the current alarm time (the snooze time can be specified in the top right corner).
In addition to the alarm addition button, the user interface also includes an "EXIT" button, which closes the program.
